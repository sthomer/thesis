semantic memory is grounded in sequential memory
  this gives the time domain necessary for further fourier transforms

fourier transform of a given trajectory is the superimposition/sum/combination of lower points

Write down stuff that you understand!
  bullet points are fine
  weekly summary before status check

trajectories are JUST the sequence they do not create properties -> property spaces

Nextweek: talking about the design
  grasp what a sequence is
  how would we represent a sequence in code??
