# Hilbert Spaces as Generalized Conceptual Spaces

# Introduction
* High-level overview



## Representation
* Connectionist -> Conceptual -> Symbolic

### Conceptual Spaces
* Basics
* Higher-order conceptual spaces (chella)

### Hilbert Spaces
* Basics
* Applications
* Jist of application to Conceptual Spaces



## Cognitive Architectures and Models
* survey?

### Global Workspace Theory
* Baars

### Hierarchical Bayesian Models
* Chater, Tenenbaum, etc.
* Form-Structure Discovery



## Oscillations
* Oscillatory nature of the brain
* Frequency representation of time

### Speech Analysis Techniques
* MMCP
* PPM
* etc.

### Fourier Transforms
* Fourier Transform
* Discrete Fourier Transform
* Multidimensional Fourier Transform
* Fast Fourier Transform
* Multidimensional Fast Fourier Transform



## IDyOT
* Basics
* Consolidation as Re-representation

### Information Theory
* Shannon information theory basics
* Markov Models
* N-gram models (bigram models)

### Abstraction during Segmentation
