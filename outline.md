# Hilbert Spaces as Generalized Conceptual Spaces in the Information Dynamics of Learning

# Theory

## Conceptual Spaces
* Definition & Examples
* Motivation
* Connectionist, Conceptual, Symbolic
* Higher-order conceptual spaces

## Hilbert Spaces
* Definition
* Motivation (oscillations)
* Application to Conceptual Spaces
* Choice of Inner Product

## Information Theory
* Motivation (from Baars)
* Entropy and Information Content
* Markov Models
* Bigram models?

## Inductive Constraints / Hierarchical Bayesian Models
* Multiple levels of abstraction constrain one another

## Spectral Representation
* Frequency representation removes time
* Neuroscience evidence

## Information Dynamics of Thinking
* Sequential Memory
* Semantic Memory
* GW Theory?
* Toward Cognitively Natural Spaces and Operators?

# Implementation

## Categorization
* Geometric categorization
* Information Content Reduction vs. Categorical Convexity
* Determination of the radius
* Other categorization schemes?

## Segmentation
* Difference function
* Problems with sparsity
* Symbol generation

## Interpolation
* Motivation
* Explanation of Resolution
* Interpolation schemes (e.g. linear vs smooth)

## Abstraction (Transformation)
* Fourier Transform of segments

## Tensors
* Definition
* Motivation
* Hilbert Spaces + Linear Operators

## Inner Products
* Clarification examples
* Implemented metrics (euclidian only?)

# Comparison & Inspiration
* Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
* NLP / Speech processing stuff?
* Transformers Architecture (NLP)
